# Resume Writing and Entry-Level Roles

## Turn Your Hobbies Into Momentum

Over the last few months, I have reviewed multiple entry-level cybersecurity resumes in community servers and for friends. Across all of them, I noticed several trends and common mistakes that reduce competitiveness while also making it challenging for companies to know your worth. I will first break down my resume reviewing process and how I evaluate your skills. 

The first thing I do is I skim over the resume and see if anything is designed to catch my eye. Thee are skills, bullet points, or sections that are presented in a manner that demands your attention. I have two examples of share of good and bad eye-catchers. The first good one was a mid-level infpsec professional who had a traditional resume layout but they had 'buttons' on the bottom 3/4th of their resume that listed their high-level skills: Adversary Simulation, Configuration Assessment, Active Directory, etc. This gave me a quick snapshot of what sphere they reside in. 

I shift my eyes back to their job section and see bullets that quickly confirm that they are experienced with red teaming skills. However, I then went over a resume for a recent graduate. They had a giant colored column on their resume which listed over 20 skills and crammed all their jobs and other experience to the side. It was impossible to skim their resume because of this column so you had to focus on reading each line. They focused on listing every possible skill a job might look for, but offered no evidence to back up their claims. I came away not even knowing what they did in any of their roles or what they got out of their education. 

When you have experience it is easy to highlight your strengths, but what about when you are a fresh graduate? You could list every skill under the sun, but if you fail to give examples of how you learned that skill or applied it, you will always come up short. This is why I added a "projects" tab to my resume where I listed my 3 main projects and how I took new skills and technologies out of them. Each project was niche and focused on the sphere I was applying to, but you could also build out projects in different areas. Another thing is these do not need to be coding projects. You can make a blog, hardware related to a hobby, or even scripts to assist with group activities. Anything can become relevant to cybersecurity. 

- Do you reguarly go mountain biking with friends? 
  - You usually scope out a trail, assess risk, and plan out which obstacles you ride. 
  - You could create a mobile app to calculate the risk of an obstacle or a site where riders can leave feedback on a trail. 
 
All of this can translate over smoothly to a project category. 

Not everyone is fortunate to have the time to create a detailed project with their career in mind, but you can still make the most of your college clubs and classes. 

## Leave out Filler

When I look at education, I want to see what you got from the last 4 years. It is evident you graduated, so don't write a bullet about how you gradudated. Also do not mention your GPA, honors, or the fact your school is 'accredited'. All of those distract a reader from the actual purpose of this section. What actual takeaways do you have from your studies? 

- Mention your role in clubs and your impact in them.
- Highlight 2-3 core classes that are relevant to this role.
  - You can hotswap these out per application. 
- Any other relevant takeways from the last 4 years.

### Bad Example:

> **Darkhedge Coven College 2019**
> - Bachelor's of Science - Computer Science
> - Graduated Cum Laude 3.6 with a degree in our nationally accredited Computer Science program with a concentration in networking. Darkhedge's courses are highly practical with a focus on real-world examples. While I was a student here, I was involved in the coding club. 

### Good Example:

> **Breakridge Guild College 2020**
> - B.S in CS
> - Led the Breakridge Coding Club to nationals in the Arkansas Coding Competition 3 years in a row while mentoring 10 freshmen each season. 
> - Built a network scanner in CS394 that was used to identify vulnerable ports in our department's network, assisted Sysadmin in patching and report writing.
> - Demonstrated knowledge of cybersecurity in CS442 where I built a script to extract Emotet payloads from maldocs, empowering our college's security team to block malicious websites faster while 18 other colleges ended up compromised. 

## Style and Polish

The worst thing I recieved recently was a neon-colored resumes, where just reading it hurts your eyes. A harsh bright color on top of a white background, with geometric obstructions in the same color scheme. The only time you should add color is for the section headers to highlight either the first letter or first word. They need to be designed to appear 'soft' and easy to read. 

When building out your resume, you should be able to skim it in under 30 seconds and understand it. Each section should flow into the next. The easiest way is to organize your bullet points in increasing or decreasing length to keep the eyes moving. 

### Example:

> **Orcish Lounge Aviation** - *Security Analyst*
> - Responsible for monitoring 40 embedded systems and 200 workstations at the SOC while. 
> - Handling ticket escalations by performing initial triage on alerts. 
> - Working with supervisors to design security awareness training. 
> - Created Powershell queries to detect SquirrelWaffle. 

These are just a handful of tips I use to design my resume and help my friends, colleagues, and community members with theirs. I will be uploading 2 demo resumes later to elaborate on the points above. 

For reference, I used an edited version of [Awesome-CV](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/awesome-cv/dfnvtnhzhhbm). It makes editing and tracking your achievements easy, especially with [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com).

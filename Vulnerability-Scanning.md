This article is not meant to be a walkthrough of Nessus or other tools, but instead are my thoughts on using them as well as a review of the book "Practical Vulnerability Management."

## Exploring Nessus

Whenever I run into a tutorial involving Nessus, I groan. The installation process and wait to boot it up fills me with an intense dread. By the time it has finished, I could have the output from an intense Nmap scan combined with Nikto into a clean report. However, this is a tradeoff for the massive functionality Nessus provides. The automation built and reporting features make it ideal for a corporate setting and it is no wonder I see it listed on most job requirements for internal security engineering positions. 

As I go through [TryHackMe's Nessus Room](https://tryhackme.com/room/rpnessusredux), I am once again reminded of the breadth of options that this tool provides its operator. From host discovery to niche scans for specific exploits, to the plethora of options for each scan, it is packed with power. One such power are the "policies" that an operator can create. These are custom templates to define what Nessus does during a scan. Another powerful resource is the ability to change the severity of plugins, as well as limiting rules to certain hosts or within a range of time. 

Another major feature that Nessus brings to the corporate table is its "Credentialed Patch Audit" scan. This allows Nessus to find what updates a host is missing, which is critical for ensuring security updates are applied and that helping your organization follow compliance. 

I've run Nessus scans before, but never saw the point in the extra modules until I went through the THM room. The plugins provided with each scan type not only augment its purpose, but also highlight what Nessus is looking for with each scan type. Running scans takes a noticeable amount of time, but that is to be expected given the scope Nessus searches to find vulnerabilities.

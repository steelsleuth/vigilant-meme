# A new resource is here & looking at tool updates

## Allstar Hours
After 6 years of collecting bookmarks, but never using them, I discovered the reason why. As I continued to expand my bookmark lists, add intricate folders, and dive into new topics, I lost track of what I had previously done and what was left. My 600 bookmarks merged together into an ocean of URLs that were inseparable from each other. There needs to be a structure to learning and this is what so many of us miss when we research new skills.

I curated my links down to 300 and organized them by broad categories. These are a starting point but there is work left to do. The curated set can be found at [Awesome Allstar Security](https://github.com/steelsleuth/Awesome-Allstar-Security). The next step will be to create learning paths for each major skills, showing which links to visit in order, providing additional exercises, labs, and content to ensure you understand the skill. This approach is inspired by [Forrest Knight's Open Source CS curriculum](https://github.com/ForrestKnight/open-source-cs).

Creating several open-source curriculum on my own is a major feat and will take several months to finish. If you would like to help, just open an issue and I will get in touch. 


## EmThreat Updates
I will also be resuming my work on EmThreat. The current roadmap for it has not been published but it follows along this path:

1.4 release on September 20th
- Features graphing

1.5 release on October 4th
- Feature improved reporting
  - Exports to XLS, CSV
  - Custom columns
- New optional columns for graphing 

1.6 release on October 18th
- Check neighboring IP blocks for phish
- Identify top countries and IP blocks
- URLhaus support

1.7 release on November 1st
- Integration with snort
- Additional features may be added


1.8/1.9 will look at creating generic modules to interact with APIs, allow users to create new modules for EmThreat, and integrate your own data collection pipeline.

One feature that was cut was Exploit-DB integration. There is a lot I want to do regarding exploits, such as identifying CVE's by recently vulnerable software. I foresee this possibly growing too fast, so it would likely become its own tool. I will explore this more in October.

## As always

If you want to work on projects, open an issue and I will be notified. I have a variety of other projects I want to resume later on or even move on to new ones. I am currently learning Ruby to create web applications which will make future tools user friendly and easily adaptable to your environment.

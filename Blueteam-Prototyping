# Prototypes & Design

I have finished a mockup of what the initial Minimum Viable Product (MVP) will be for the blue teaming job site I mentioned several weeks ago. There will be just 4 main screens that the user has to interact with. This means that developing them will be quick and we can focus on the core experience of whether or not this style of job matching solves the problem that hiring managers and job seekers face.

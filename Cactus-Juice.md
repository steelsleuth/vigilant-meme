As Cactus Con 10 approaches us (February 4 - 5) I thought it was best to revisit my notes from CC9 and highlight some of the most interesting tidbits of advice from the community. This is not a comprehensive list, but I will try to cover various topics geared towards beginners in the industry.

### Tech Learning
These are some resources from the section on learning tech.

https://samsclass.info/ - For various infosec classes by Sam Bowne, most notably Violent Python  (https://samsclass.info/124/VP2020.htm + https://samsclass.info/124/ViolentPython.shtml) 

https://pauljerimy.com/security-certification-roadmap/ - The famous Paul Jerimy roadmap for infosec certifications. This should never be used as a “gotta catch em all” guide, but instead help you figure out what certifications to look into for various areas and study their syllabi to determine if that is the best career fit for you. 

There are a lot of recommended “awesome” lists, but I encourage newcomers to stay far away from those. You’ll just end up with a folder of lists for every topic and never dive into any of them. Pick a single area and dive deep, resurfacing only to wade into another area. 

https://www.sans.org/security-resources/ - Free assets from SANS. The only time you should consider taking their courses is when a corporation is willing to bankroll you taking their courses. 

### Radio Frequency

https://rfhackers.com/ - A group of experts in radio frequency security

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL618122BD66C8B3C4 - GNU Radio Tutorial Series

https://www.rtl-sdr.com/ - Software Defined Radio news and projects. 

https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8BogY0hWwvyyrU-puszZ9K-lj1It6XTd - Machine learning for security analysts

### Lockpicking

https://toool.us/resources.html - Resources from The Open Organisation Of Lockpickers

General tips: Any lock is a practice lock. The ‘clear’ locks are educational and for understanding how the internals react to your pick. Once you understand the fundamentals, ditch clear acrylics and start working through any locks you have on hand. 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AayXf5aRFTI&ab_channel=WildWestHackin%27Fest - Interesting talk from Wild West Hacking Fest on copying keys.

https://www.sparrowslockpicks.com/product_p/nightschool.htm - Rather expensive starter kit.

### Wrap-Up

This was a short list but covers some key assets from a few areas. Before you start your own learning, you need to take inventory of what time you have and what interests you, before picking no more than 5 resources to begin your journey into a new world. 

Let’s assume you would want to get into Ethical Hacking / Penetration Testing. Most ‘ethical hacking’ would actually fall under Web Application Pen testing and be in the bug bounty sphere, so you already have to choose between pursuing that area or specifically learning Penetration Testing. We will assume you want to become a Penetration Tester. 

Your inventory would comprise of:
1. https://tryhackme.com/
2. https://academy.tcm-sec.com/ (free videos on the youtube channel)
3. https://www.offensive-security.com/metasploit-unleashed/
4. https://pentesterlab.com/
5. And the classic https://jhalon.github.io/becoming-a-pentester/

As you might notice, each of these links has various exercises or leads to other resources. Just these 5 areas quickly spiral out of control into an interweaving web of knowledge. The last one is definitely the ultimate primer on pen testing and sends you off into so many areas. I would ignore all the links and focus entirely on the written knowledge contained in it. When reading blog posts for any area of study, ignore the suggestions and links. Focus on that pure content until you understand it and can make your own choice about where to go with a sense of direction.

# Achieving Success in Computer Science, Cybersecurity, and more

Two years ago I wrote an article on how to succeed while studying computer science. Fast-forwarding to today, one of the students I mentioned has received their graduate degree in CS. The specific section referencing them mentioned "[he] would always over-archive and try to expand the programs he was given". I have taught and been friends with a fair number of students who took this approach and built up impressive portfolios that landed them at Google, Amazon, and Facebook. However, this opens the door to several questions. 

## Is it always fair?

Is it fair for us to ask students to go beyond the curriculum and treat independent studies as a part-time job on top of their courses?  Is it also fair to expect students to network on top of this while producing blog content or videos to further demonstrate their understanding of the same topics that their degree is supposed to be proof of? 

The answer that I provided last time was “we cannot teach every student.” Every professor faces the issue of adjusting their syllabus pace so that the top percentile are not bored while the bottom percentile are not left behind. While listening to the [Game Dev Advice podcast Ep 31](https://www.gamedevadvice.com/) with guest Clark Stacey, CEO of WildWorks, a novel solution was proposed to turn learning into a video game so that students could face content on their level and teachers could be notified about which students needed supplemental assistance. 

Until degree programs can provide that level of attention to each student, it falls upon them to stand out in their own way. A portfolio is common advice, but you can use your previous work as stepping stones towards a specialization. One professor would always say “the programs you make are now a part of your tool kit.” 

## Create a GitHub account and take inventory of the programs you have been working on

It is important to note that you need to make sure you can publicly share some programs, so talk with your professor first. However, I am not suggesting to upload all your work from CS101 or even the raw work from an algorithms class. Everyone has a repo full of algorithms in every language. You need to take an algorithm and apply it to something. 

In my case, I found a paper published by UAB describing an algorithm to find substrings in phishing URLs. I researched this topic in detail and presented a demo in an elective course I was taking. However, the demo was horribly optimized. This gave me a challenge to work towards and to figure out how this program could be used in real world applications. 

At a Hackathon I attended, two great students wrote a program to analyze news articles for bias. It was a command-line program that was pushed out after a full day of coding, but imagine if they took it and converted it into an app. You could take your phone out, scan an article you are reading, and it would identify any bias in the piece. The same Hackathon also led to the creation of a parking-finder webapp that worked similarly to Waze. 

There are great ideas to be passionate about everywhere, but how can you reasonably approach this? The mistake I made was spending hours working on projects for short sprints. In reality, you need to spend just 15-30 minutes everyday slowly reviewing your code and researching. Consistency builds up over time. I’m currently doing a 30-day writing advent to slowly build up my writing skills each day! 

## Base your growth on a single project or topic, then nurture that over time

If I was a junior looking for a plan to launch my career in 2 years, these are the 5 steps I would take:

1. Pick a specialization (IoT, Robotics, GameDev, Data, Infosec, anything you think of)
2. Go through [MIT’s Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/)
3. Share your learning on GitHub as either a blog or raw notes.
4. Turn your favorite idea into your flagship project while following [Simon’s Advice](https://twitter.com/SimonHoiberg/status/1424992325869133855)
5. Be consistent with learning while saving time for yourself.

Overall, whatever path you pick is your own and it is up to you to mold a plan to your goals. Just keep it simple no matter what. For a bonus, [watch this video by Jonas Tyroller on productivity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DlVkznQwtww).

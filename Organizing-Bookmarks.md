### The Challenge
Over the years I have accumulated hundreds of bookmarks and links. It has gotten to the point where I spent more time lost than learning. As part of creating this blog, I have begun to review every link I have saved to curate them into a list. This list will be posted to GitHub and contain relevant links to InfoSec, DFIR, Pentesting, and CS topics that I feel are relevant to anyone in this field.

While I have a CS background, I feel that most coding resources are geared to high schoolers and repeat the same exercises without any progression. I have written 3 LinkedIn articles on learning cybersecurity and computer science. Looking back on those, my resolve on what it takes to succeed is further engrained by my current experiences. 

The biggest mistake people make when trying to pick up any skill is not knowing how to ask questions. The art of learning to ask good questions will not only solve many problems you run into, but help build the problem-solving mindset you will need to succeed. In fact, the first person you should ask questions is yourself. Why did this program fail? Why does this loop not work properly? What functions are being called? Learning to examine your own work will save you hours of mindless debugging. Once you understand the actual problem, you can then ask a specific question and get the answer that is most relevant to your problem. 

This also goes hand in hand with research skills. You must know how to ask good questions in order to utilize search engines to their full potential. By practicing "google dorking", or using advanced search operators to find content, then most of your problems will be solved in a significantly shorter time frame than before. 

The desire to challenge yourself and grow as an individual is the primary driving force behind 'success' in this field, but what is actual success? To me, success is being proud of the work you made. When I look at the individuals who asked questions, did their own research, and excitedly learned new topics, I see them all succeeding in various forms. While getting a good job and a sustainable salary are important, being able to feel successful is even more critical.  

Circling back to the bookmarks, it is quite difficult to organize hundreds of links in a manner that is comprehensive. There are plenty of "awesome" lists out there with sprawling tables of contents. I find the best way forwards is to create topics for every link and then order then 'sequentially' in the order you want to learn them. This way you can swap between topics or continue the track you are already learning. 

I am currently at 593 bookmarks, but I will hopefully curate this number down significantly. I will also be only curating 40 or so links each weekend to not overwhelm myself. Given my other projects, this seems like a good tradeoff.

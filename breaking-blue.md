# A New Adventure Breaking into Blue Teaming

Over the last few years, I have been interested in startups. I lacked the confidence in my skils, the dedication to carry out the 40 hour weeks, and the support from co-founders to stay on track. Despite these setbacks, I have been learning more about programming and what it takes to launch a startup. 

I have a comfortable job at an amazing company, which I am not leaving any time soon. There is a growing misconception you need to quit everything for a startup, but this is flawed. It follows the same logic as the new college graduates who think they need to move to California to get paid more, without recognizing the cost associated with that decision. I believe most startups can be done part-time, on your time. 

## What am I making?

I am making a web app to help talented blue teamers land their next job, while also giving tools to managers in their persuit of candidates. I have been a professional for almost 2 years now, but I have spent the last decade following the industry closely. Every year we end up with the same trend of having too many openings and people who are willing to learn are turned aside in favor of sub-optimal candidates that had the money to invest in a 4-year degree or over-priced certification. Your company should not be using these criteria in any meaningful decision. The best criteria involves matching an employee to a company based on their shared culture. 

I will be gathering feedback over the next few weeks to pinpoint the main categories associated with work culture, as well as the essence of blue team skills. A Minimum-Viable-Product will contain the barebones features needed to validate this idea, which can be iterated on. I will be sharing updates on this, but the first thing I will have to do is create a specification for what this application needs. I will be able to break down the ToDo's in a manner that lets me learn how to implement the features I need while also using them as blog updates. 


If you want to help me out, just let me know.

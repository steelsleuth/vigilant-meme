## Behind the Duck

I go by QuackHack, an infosec persona used to channel my creative energy in an industry of endless knowledge and resources. I was first exposed to the industry in 2012 thanks to Cisco’s training program and attended my first conference in 2016. In 2020 I finally broke into the industry to study email-based threats. My interests are constantly changing, but I am passionate about penetration testing and am also interested in threat intelligence, hardware hacking, and looking deeper into IoT devices. I am currently pivoting into incident response and am excited to see what challenges this brings.

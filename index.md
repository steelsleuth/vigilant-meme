## Welcome to my Blog

This is the personal blog of a security researcher who is fond of buying too many books. My views obviously are my own and do not reflect my company or any organization I could represent. 

I plan to publish an article each week on a variety of topics, primarily surrounding content I am learning.

### Current Learning List
- Security+
- Pentesting
- TTPs of ATPs that purchase network access

### Current Development Checklist
- [EmThreat](https://github.com/steelsleuth/EmThreat) 
- Projects related to identifying threat groups

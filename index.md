## Welcome to my Blog 🦆🖥️

This is my personal blog, focused on security/malware research and other topics. My views obviously are my own and do not reflect my company or any organization I could represent. This is mostly used to track what I am learning (game development, tools, books) and publish updates on software I work on.
